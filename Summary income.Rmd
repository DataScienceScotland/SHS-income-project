We compared SHS 2018 income data (the new, broader definition) with HBAI 2018/19 income data. For the HBAI data, we didn't use the standard income variable,  but instead used income before top-income adjustment, and ignored child income (except for benefits) and any income deductions, such as all maintenance and child support payments, parental contributions to students living away from home, or student loan repayments. This way, we can compare the data from the surveys more directly and don't (initially at least) focus on any discrepancies that originate not from the collected data itself but the data processing at a later stage. We also set negative earnings and investment income in the HBAI to zero {>> I assume these come from negative net profits of the self-employed <<}, as there are no negative earnings and investments in the SHS. 

We also looked at administrative data on benefits to quantify the amount of benefit underreporting in the SHS (and the HBAI).

Note that all income discussed here is net income after benefits and tax, and not taking housing costs into account (similar to BHC income).

# SHS earnings higher 

Median and mean earnings are higher in the SHS compared to the HBAI, but aggregated total earnings are lower. 

Across income deciles, median earnings match fairly well. There is more earnings variation in the top decile and the lowest two deciles, and less in the 3rd to 9th decile. However, the 3rd income decile is the only one where median earnings in the SHS are markedly lower than in the HBAI. Note that this is the income decile where the poverty threshold is typically located, and small differences in the income distribution here can have a big effect on poverty numbers.

Median earnings of households where the head is employed (both, full- or part-time) match fairly well between surveys, but those where the head is self-employed have much higher earnings in the SHS.  Checking with the (yet unpublished SHS 2019) dataset shows that this high level of self-employed earnings is consistent across years. This level may be much higher than in the HBAI because the SHS doesn't deduct losses. {>> check with SHS team <<} Note however, that the self-employed group is quite small. 

The discrepancy in aggregated total earnings between surveys is the result of both, large differences for (the few) self-employed households, and smaller differences for (the many) employed households. And as well as differences in the _average earnings_ (which are higher in the SHS), there are also differences in the _number of households_ who have any earnings (lower in the SHS).

Looking at council areas, note that HBAI data cannot be meaningfully analysed at a sub-Scotland level, as the weighting regime for the survey doesnâ€™t account for geography within Scotland. There are therefore large discrepancies for council areas across surveys. Having said that, if we do compare those (ten) council areas where household numbers are similar between SHS and HBAI (difference < 50%), median earnings match fairly well.

# SHS benefits lower 

```{r bendiff, echo=FALSE}

bendiff <- tidydata %>%
  group_by(survey, type) %>%
  summarise(amount = sum(amount*hhwgt*equ)) %>%
  spread(survey, amount) %>%
  mutate(totdiff = HBAI[1] - SHS[1],
         diff = HBAI - SHS,
         diffcontr = diff/totdiff) %>%
  filter(type == "ben") %>%
  select(diffcontr) %>%
  mutate(diffcontr = percent(diffcontr, 1)) %>% pull()

```

Generally, benefit income is lower in the SHS than in the HBAI. The lower benefit income in the SHS explains `r bendiff` of the total income difference between these two surveys. (Note that when comparing benefit incomes, one should keep in mind that benefits in the HBAI are already underreported (to varying degrees)). The lower benefit income in the SHS is caused by: fewer households reporting they receive a benefit or households not reporting all the benefits they receive, and households reporting (on average) smaller benefit payments.

**Working-age households** (defined here as households with no adults above state pension age) receive on average much lower benefits compared to pensioner households. Benefit income of working-age households in the top five income deciles is mainly made up of disability benefits, followed by Child Benefit. In the lower income deciles, average benefit income increases, and is made up of disability benefits and Child Benefit, and increasingly (with lower incomes) also with Tax Credits, Housing Benefit and Universal Credit. Benefit income of the bottom income decile is quite low (lower than in deciles 2-4), a common feature of survey-based income data, and probably due to various reporting errors. 

When comparing benefit income for working-age households across the two surveys, it appears that disability benefits, Tax Credits, Child Benefit and Universal Credit are lower in the SHS. This suggests underreporting of these benefits (which we will confirm later). The lower income deciles also show large data variability with large uncertainty for both surveys.

**Pensioner households** have on average a much higher benefit income, due to the State Pension, which is the main benefit income source. This is followed by disability benefits, Housing Benefit and Pension Credit. Average benefit income for pensioner households matches reasonably well across surveys except for the lowest two income deciles, where C.I.s don't overlap, with the SHS estimates far below the HBAI ones. This can be explained by underreporting of State Pension in the SHS, in particular in the bottom decile.

Median benefit income across the two surveys matches better for some **household types** than for others. For example, median benefit income of households with two adults with children, or households with one adult and one pensioner match ok. On the other hand, median benefit incomes for single adult households and households with two pensioners differ considerably, and C.I.s don't overlap at all. 

For **single adult households**, this is caused by people underreporting disability benefits in the SHS, see [Single adults' benefit incomes][Single adults' benefit incomes]. 

For **pensioner couple households**, the difference in median benefit income between the two surveys is largely due to non-reporting of state pension for some people. {>> it's not clear why this isn't also the case for single pensioners - follow up? <<}

Looking at household **economic status**, median benefit incomes for households where the highest income householder is a full-time employee match well between surveys and show a small benefit amount and little variability. There is more variability and discrepancy in median benefit incomes for part-time employee and self-employed households. Median benefit income C.I.s from SHS and HBAI do not overlap at all for retired and disabled households, with the SHS benefit incomes consistently below HBAI benefit incomes. Reasons for this are largely non-reporting of state pension, and under- and non-reporting of disability benefits.

Looking across **council areas**, we need to remind ourselves that the HBAI is not designed for sub-Scotland level analysis, and household numbers in each council area are not designed to be accurate. However, removing those council areas with very large (>50%) discrepancies in number of households, and also excluding council areas with too small sample sizes, we're left with 13 council areas for comparison across surveys. In these, benefit incomes match reasonably well with SHS benefit income consistently slightly below HBAI benefit income, but with C.I.s that overlap, except for Fife. 

## Benefit types

The largest benefit by far is the State Pension, which makes up almost half of all benefit income. This is followed by the combined disability and carers' benefits, followed by Tax Credits, Housing Benefit, Child Benefit, Universal Credit, Pension Credit, and many smaller benefits.

All of the big benefits except for Housing Benefit are underreported in the SHS compared to the HBAI. (Note that the HBAI underreports all benefits compared to administrative data.) This could be due to underreporting of the amount received, not reporting a benefit, or a combination of both. Underreporting of State Pension and disability benefits explains most of the benefit income differences between the two surveys.

The underreporting of all but one benefits means that those household types with a large share of their income from benefits will show a lower income in the SHS compared to the HBAI. This affects households with low or no earnings: pensioners, who receive a large part of their income through the state pension (and other, smaller benefits such as Pension Credit and Winter Fuel Payment), and households with disabled household members who receive disability and carers' benefits. I expect it also affects other low-earnings households through Tax Credits and Universal Credit. These households will show too low an income in the SHS.

To add more detail, **State Pension** is fairly well covered in the HBAI (93%), but less so in the SHS (78%). This discrepancy explains 48% of the total benefit income difference between HBAI and SHS. It originates in a smaller number of individuals in the SHS reporting that they receive State Pension, even though the average payments are comparable between surveys.

Combined **disability and carers' benefits** are covered to 73% in the HBAI, and only to 56% in the SHS. These include Disability Living Allowance, Personal Independence Payment, Attendance Allowance, Employment Support Allowance, Carers' Allowance, Severe Disablement Allowance, and Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit. I included Carers Allowance in this list as I expect most carers to live in the same household as the person they care for. The discrepancy between HBAI and SHS disability benefit incomes explains a further 30% of the total benefit income difference between HBAI and SHS. Disability benefits in the SHS are subject to both, underreporting of the amount, and non-reporting of receipt.

**Tax credits** are also underreported in the SHS compared to the HBAI, explaining a further 9% of the benefit income difference between the surveys. A large part of this is part-time employee households underrerporting the amount of Tax Credit they get. Both surveys vastly underreport Tax Credit compared to admin data. 

**Housing Benefit** is underreported to a similar degree in both surveys.

**Child Benefit** income in the SHS is only slightly lower than in the HBAI, due to some households with two adults and children not reporting receipt of this benefit.

**Universal Credit** and **Pension Credit** are both vastly underreported in the SHS, explaining another 8% each of the total benefit income difference between HBAI and SHS. For both benefits, the received amounts are underreported. In addition, there is allso a lot of non-reporting of Pension Credit receipt.

## Single adults' benefit incomes

Many more single adult households in the SHS than the HBAI report (any) benefit income, and therefore aggregated benefit income for single adult households is higher in the SHS compared to the HBAI. However, we have seen that for this household type, average benefit income is lower in the SHS. This is mainly driven by underreporting of disability benefits in the SHS, which, combined, are the most valuable benefits for this group.

## Areas for further investigation:

- why do many pensioners not report state pension receipt in the SHS? Look at question wording?
- benefit income by urban/rural?

# Investment income

Investment income is hugely underreported in the SHS compared to the HBAI, even though we are using the HBAI data before top-income adjustments (which would correct top incomes upwards). The massively lower investment income in the SHS is largely due to non-reporting of any investment income. Most of investment income is held by retired households, and by working-age two adult households; these are therefore the groups whose income is affected more. Similarly, most of investment income is held by the richest households.

# Pensioners' incomes

The aggregated (total) income for One Pensioner, One Adult matches (slightly) better between SHS and HBAI than the aggregated income for Single Pensioners and Pensioner Couples. This is because this group's income comes largely from earnings, which are higher in the SHS and offset the lower benefit income. For Single Pensioners and Pensioner Couples, the differences in total income come mainly from benefit income (which is mainly the state pension), but also from differences in occupational pensions and investment income. The difference in investment income is due to non-reporting of investment income in the SHS compared to the HBAI: fewer people in the SHS report having any income from investments. Similarly, fewer people in the SHS report any occupational pension income, although in the aggregate, the SHS occupational penions income is only slightly below that in the HBAI.

Looking at Pension Credit, an income-related benefits for pensioners, sample sizes are too small for further breakdowns, but this benefit is subject to both, underreporting of the amount, and non-reporting of receipt for SHS, compared to HBAI.

- occupational pensions

# Income components 

Total income aggregated to the  whole of Scotland is largely made up of earnings, followed by benefits (which include the state pension) and occupational pensions. Overall, SHS total income is `r incdiff` lower than HBAI total income. The differences come mainly from lower benefit and much lower investment income in the SHS, and then also from lower occupational pensions. Income from earnings are slightly higher in the SHS. Other income components are relatively small and therefore contribute little to the overall differences in income. {>> Do investment incomes matter much for poverty (= low income) measurement though? <<}

For all quintiles, the aggregated total income is higher in the HBAI compared to SHS, with the difference increasing with higher incomes. Note that we showed earlier that this was similar for the income decile points, but that the differences *decreased* with higher incomes. 

For the lowest income quintile, aggregated earnings income reported in the SHS is higher than in the HBAI. Benefits are considerably lower though and largely explain why total SHS income is lower than HBAI income in this quintile. In the second income quintile (this is where the poverty threshold sits), the higher HBAI earnings income largely explains the differences in total aggregated incomes in this quintile. In the third and fourth income quintiles, SHS earnings are again higher than HBAI earnings. However, differences in benefit, occupational pension, and investment incomes lead to a lower total income in the SHS in these quintiles. In the top quintile, total income differences are due to differences in incomes from all major sources, but in particular occupational pensions and income from investments.


# Total income overall 

The income **distributions** in the SHS and the HBAI look largely similar, with the SHS income distribution being slightly wider, and the SHS **median** slightly lower. Near the relative poverty threshold, the SHS cumulative income curve is higher, meaning more households sit below that threshold in the SHS compared to the HBAI. This means that more people are considered to be in relative poverty when using the SHS dataset compared to the HBAI dataset.

The nine income decile points (the thresholds in each dataset that split the populations in ten equal-sized groups) are at similar levels in the two surveys for high incomes, and diverge towards lower incomes, with SHS incomes being lower. This shows that more households in the SHS have lower incomes compared to the HBAI, whereas the high income end of the distribution matches better between surveys. We will later see that this might be caused by benefit underreporting in the SHS (relative to the HBAI). The lower the income, the more important benefit income becomes, and the more affected total income is by benefit underreporting.

{>> chart: aggregated income components by total income decile <<}

For the analysis which followed, 95% confidence intervals (C.I.) of the median were calculated using a bootstrapping method. For the HBAI, the boostrapped C.I.s do not account for the complex survey design. They are therefore only illustrative and may be wider. 

Median income C.I.s overlap to some degree for all 22 **council areas** where the HBAI sample size is large enough. ( >=50). For some council areas, the overlaps are only marginal, such as Glasgow, Renfrewshire, Aberdeenshire, East Dunbartonshire, and Stirling, even though some of these have relatively large HBAI sample sizes (Aberdeenshire, Glasgow, Renfrewshire). {>> It would be good to check what the overlaps look like for different data years, i.e. SHS 2019 (pre-release access only) or HBAI 2017/18 <<}

Median incomes match fairly well for **urban** and accessible rural areas. Median incomes in remote rural areas match slightly less well, but also have the smalles HBAI sample. Median incomes in small towns match the worst.

Median income of **working-age adults** and **children** match well, but **pensioners**' incomes are much lower in the SHS and C.I.s do not overlap.

Incomes for most **household types** match well, except for pensioners, whose income is much lower in the SHS. Single pensioner and pensioner couples' income C.I.s don't overlap. Incomes of households with 3 or more adults and no children have very wide C.I.s, indicating large variation of incomes in this group.

Incomes of households where the household head (the highest income householder) is a full- or part-time employee match well, suggesting that income from employed earnings may also match well. Income of self-employed households varies widely and C.I.s overlap only little between the two survey. Incomes of the retired don't match well, similarly to pensioners' incomes in the age group and household type breakdowns. Incomes of the disabled also don't match too well.

**Areas for further investigation: **

- self-employed income (?) - this might just be variation, check this with SHS 19 dataset
- council areas that don't match well - is this because they depend more on benefit income??
