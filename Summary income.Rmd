From previous work done comparing SHS and HBAI data, we expect the average total income to be matching fairly well, even if the individual income components might not match well enough for detailed analysis due to the different remits of the two surveys and resulting methods. Here, we look at how the individual income components differ between the surveys and how that might affect different groups of the population differently.

We compared SHS 2018 income data (the new, broader definition) with HBAI 2018/19 income data. For the HBAI data, we didn't use the standard income variable,  but instead used income before top-income adjustment, and ignored child income (except for benefits) and any income deductions, such as all maintenance and child support payments, parental contributions to students living away from home, or student loan repayments. This way, we can compare the data from the surveys more directly and don't (initially at least) focus on any discrepancies that originate not from the collected data itself but the data processing at a later stage. We also set negative earnings and investment income in the HBAI to zero {>> I assume these come from negative net profits of the self-employed <<}, as there are no negative earnings and investments in the SHS. 

We also looked at administrative data on benefits to quantify the amount of benefit underreporting in the SHS (and the HBAI).

Note that all income discussed here is net income after benefits and tax, and not taking housing costs into account (similar to BHC income).

For the analysis, 95% confidence intervals (C.I.) of the median were calculated using a bootstrapping method. For the HBAI, the boostrapped C.I.s do not account for the complex survey design. They are therefore only illustrative and may be wider. The C.I.s calculated for the SHS take into account the survey design (stratification by council areas). 

# SHS earnings higher 

Median and mean earnings are higher in the SHS compared to the HBAI, driven by much higher average self-employed earnings, but aggregated total earnings are lower, because fewer households in the SHS report that they have any earnings. 

Across income deciles, median earnings match fairly well. There is more earnings variation in the top decile and the lowest two deciles, and less in the 3rd to 9th decile. However, the 3rd income decile is the only one where median earnings in the SHS are markedly lower than in the HBAI. Note that this is the income decile where the poverty threshold is typically located, and small differences in the income distribution here can have a big effect on poverty numbers.

Median earnings of households where the head is employed (both, full- or part-time) match fairly well between surveys, but those where the head is self-employed have much higher earnings in the SHS.  Checking with the (yet unpublished SHS 2019) dataset shows that this high level of self-employed earnings is consistent across years. This level may be much higher than in the HBAI because the SHS doesn't deduct losses. {>> check with SHS team <<}

The discrepancy in aggregated total earnings between surveys is the result of both, large differences for (the few) self-employed households, and smaller differences for (the many) employed households. And as well as differences in the _average earnings_ (which are higher in the SHS), there are also differences in the _number of households_ who have any earnings (lower in the SHS).

Looking at council areas, note that HBAI data cannot be meaningfully analysed at a sub-Scotland level, as the weighting regime for the survey doesnâ€™t account for geography within Scotland. There are therefore large discrepancies for council areas across surveys. Having said that, if we do compare those (ten) council areas where household numbers are similar between SHS and HBAI (difference < 50%), median earnings match fairly well.

# SHS benefits lower 

```{r bendiff, echo=FALSE}

bendiff <- tidydata %>%
  group_by(survey, type) %>%
  summarise(amount = sum(amount*hhwgt*equ)) %>%
  spread(survey, amount) %>%
  mutate(totdiff = HBAI[1] - SHS[1],
         diff = HBAI - SHS,
         diffcontr = diff/totdiff) %>%
  filter(type == "ben") %>%
  select(diffcontr) %>%
  mutate(diffcontr = percent(diffcontr, 1)) %>% pull()

```

Generally, benefit income is lower in the SHS than in the HBAI. The lower benefit income in the SHS explains `r bendiff` of the total income difference between these two surveys. (Note that when comparing benefit incomes, one should keep in mind that benefits in the HBAI are already underreported (to varying degrees)). The lower benefit income in the SHS is caused by: fewer households reporting they receive a benefit or households not reporting all the benefits they receive, and households reporting (on average) smaller benefit payments.

**Working-age households** (defined here as households with no adults above state pension age) receive on average much lower benefits compared to pensioner households. Benefit income of working-age households in the top five income deciles is mainly made up of disability benefits, followed by Child Benefit. In the lower income deciles, average benefit income increases, and is made up of disability benefits and Child Benefit, and increasingly (with lower incomes) also with Tax Credits, Housing Benefit and Universal Credit. Benefit income of the bottom income decile is quite low (lower than in deciles 2-4), a common feature of survey-based income data, and probably due to various reporting errors. 

When comparing benefit income for working-age households across the two surveys, it appears that disability benefits, Tax Credits, Child Benefit and Universal Credit are lower in the SHS. This suggests underreporting of these benefits (which we will confirm later). The lower income deciles also show large data variability with large uncertainty for both surveys.

**Pensioner households** have on average a much higher benefit income, due to the State Pension, which is the main benefit income source. This is followed by disability benefits, Housing Benefit and Pension Credit. Average benefit income for pensioner households matches reasonably well across surveys except for the lowest two income deciles, where C.I.s don't overlap, with the SHS estimates far below the HBAI ones. This can be explained by underreporting of State Pension in the SHS, in particular in the bottom decile.

Median benefit income across the two surveys matches better for some **household types** than for others. For example, median benefit income of households with two adults with children, or households with one adult and one pensioner match ok. On the other hand, median benefit incomes for single adult households and households with two pensioners differ considerably, and C.I.s don't overlap at all. 

For **single adult households**, this is caused by people underreporting disability benefits in the SHS, see [Single adults' benefit incomes][Single adults' benefit incomes]. 

For **pensioner couple households**, the difference in median benefit income between the two surveys is largely due to non-reporting of state pension for some people. {>> it's not clear why this isn't also the case for single pensioners - follow up? <<}

Looking at household **economic status**, median benefit incomes for households where the highest income householder is a full-time employee match well between surveys and show a small benefit amount and little variability. There is more variability and discrepancy in median benefit incomes for part-time employee and self-employed households. Median benefit income C.I.s from SHS and HBAI do not overlap at all for retired and disabled households, with the SHS benefit incomes consistently below HBAI benefit incomes. Reasons for this are largely non-reporting of state pension, and under- and non-reporting of disability benefits.

Looking across **council areas**, we need to remind ourselves that the HBAI is not designed for sub-Scotland level analysis, and household numbers in each council area are not designed to be accurate. However, removing those council areas with very large (>50%) discrepancies in number of households, and also excluding council areas with too small sample sizes, we're left with 13 council areas for comparison across surveys. In these, benefit incomes match reasonably well with SHS benefit income consistently slightly below HBAI benefit income, but with C.I.s that overlap, except for Fife. 

## Benefit types

The largest benefit by far is the State Pension, which makes up almost half of all benefit income. This is followed by the combined disability and carers' benefits, followed by Tax Credits, Housing Benefit, Child Benefit, Universal Credit, Pension Credit, and many smaller benefits.

All of the big benefits except for Housing Benefit are underreported in the SHS compared to the HBAI. (Note that the HBAI underreports all benefits compared to administrative data.) This could be due to underreporting of the amount received, not reporting a benefit, or a combination of both. Underreporting of State Pension and disability benefits explains most of the benefit income differences between the two surveys.

The underreporting of all but one benefits means that those household types with a large share of their income from benefits will show a lower income in the SHS compared to the HBAI. This affects households with low or no earnings: pensioners, who receive a large part of their income through the state pension (and other, smaller benefits such as Pension Credit and Winter Fuel Payment), and households with disabled household members who receive disability and carers' benefits. I expect it also affects other low-earnings households through Tax Credits and Universal Credit. These households will show too low an income in the SHS.

To add more detail, **State Pension** is fairly well covered in the HBAI (93%), but less so in the SHS (78%). This discrepancy explains 48% of the total benefit income difference between HBAI and SHS. It originates in a smaller number of individuals in the SHS reporting that they receive State Pension, even though the average payments are comparable between surveys.

Combined **disability and carers' benefits** are covered to 73% in the HBAI, and only to 56% in the SHS. These include Disability Living Allowance, Personal Independence Payment, Attendance Allowance, Employment Support Allowance, Carers' Allowance, Severe Disablement Allowance, and Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit. I included Carers Allowance in this list as I expect most carers to live in the same household as the person they care for. The discrepancy between HBAI and SHS disability benefit incomes explains a further 30% of the total benefit income difference between HBAI and SHS. Disability benefits in the SHS are subject to both, underreporting of the amount, and non-reporting of receipt.

**Tax credits** are also underreported in the SHS compared to the HBAI, explaining a further 9% of the benefit income difference between the surveys. A large part of this is part-time employee households underrerporting the amount of Tax Credit they get. Both surveys vastly underreport Tax Credit compared to admin data. 

**Housing Benefit** is underreported to a similar degree in both surveys.

**Child Benefit** income in the SHS is only slightly lower than in the HBAI, due to some households with two adults and children not reporting receipt of this benefit.

**Universal Credit** and **Pension Credit** are both vastly underreported in the SHS, explaining another 8% each of the total benefit income difference between HBAI and SHS. For both benefits, the received amounts are underreported. In addition, there is allso a lot of non-reporting of Pension Credit receipt.

## Single adults' benefit incomes

Many more single adult households in the SHS than the HBAI report (any) benefit income, and therefore aggregated benefit income for single adult households is higher in the SHS compared to the HBAI. However, we have seen that for this household type, average benefit income is lower in the SHS. This is mainly driven by underreporting of disability benefits in the SHS, which, combined, are the most valuable benefits for this group.

## Areas for further investigation:

- why do many pensioners not report state pension receipt in the SHS? Look at question wording? Maybe model state pension instead of imputing it?
- benefit income by urban/rural?

# Investment income

Investment income is hugely underreported in the SHS compared to the HBAI, even though we are using the HBAI data before top-income adjustments (which would correct top incomes upwards). The massively lower investment income in the SHS is largely due to non-reporting of any investment income. Most of investment income is held by retired households, and by working-age two adult households; these are therefore the groups whose income is affected more. Similarly, most of investment income is held by the richest households.

# Pensioners' incomes

**Single pensioner** and **pensioner couple** households get the major part of their income from benefits, which is mainly the State Pension. As the State Pension is underreported, household income is underrerported for these household types. The underreporting of State Pension is due to both, underreporting of the amount, and non-reporting of receiving the benefit. Many single pensioners in particular did not report that they received any State Pension at all. 

In addition to differences in benefit income (which is mainly the state pension), there are also differences in occupational pensions and investment income. The difference in investment income is mostly due to non-reporting of investment income in the SHS compared to the HBAI. It should be noted that most of investment income in Scotland goes to retired households. Similarly, fewer people in the SHS report any occupational pension income, although in the aggregate, the SHS occupational pensions income is only slightly below that in the HBAI.

Households with **one working-age adult and one pensioner** get a similarly large parts of their income through earnings, benefits and occupational pensions. Their higher earnings in the SHS partly offset the lower benefits, and SHS household income of this group is closer to HBAI household income.

And finally, **Pension Credit**, an income-related benefit for pensioners is subject to both, considerable underreporting of the amount, and non-reporting of receipt for SHS, compared to HBAI.

# Self-employed incomes

Households where the head is self-employed had higher incomes in the SHS, driven by much higher earnings. This is consistent with the (yet unpublished) SHS 2019 cata, so not an artefact. On the other hand, benefit income is lower, but has much less of an impact as it is on average much less important than earnings.

Reasons for the higher earnings of the self-employed in the SHS could be because SHS doesn't account for self-employed losses, or not in the same way as the HBAI. Or the definitions of self-employment may differ between surveys.

# Income components 

Total income aggregated to the whole of Scotland is largely made up of earnings, followed by benefits (which include the state pension) and occupational pensions.

Overall, SHS total income is 8.3% lower than HBAI total income. The differences come mainly from lower benefit and much lower investment income in the SHS, and then also from lower occupational pensions. Income from earnings are higher in the SHS. Other income components are relatively small and therefore contribute little to the overall differences in income.

We have seen that the lower benefit income mostly affects pensioners (through the state pension) and households with disabled household members (though disability benefits).

We have also seen that most of the investment income goes to the wealthiest households. This will affect the income distribution most at the tope, and might therefore not matter as much when looking at low income households. However, a large part of investment income goes to retired households, so this could ascerbate the income underreporting of these households even more.

For all **income quintiles**, the aggregated total income is higher in the HBAI compared to SHS, with the largest differences at the top and at the bottom quintile. For the lowest income quintile, the difference is driven equally by lower earnings and lower benefits in the SHS.
In the second income quintile (this is where the poverty threshold sits), the difference is smaller and mainly driven by lower earnings in the SHS. In the third and fourth income quintiles, SHS earnings are now higher than HBAI earnings. However, differences in benefit income, occupational pensions and investment incomes lead to a lower total income in the SHS in these quintiles. In the top quintile, total income differences are due to differences in incomes from all major sources, but in particular investment income and occupational pensions.

The lower the total income is, the less important earnings and the more important benefits become.

As for **regional underreporting**, this is difficult to ascertain from comparison with HBAI data, because the HBAI's weighting regime doesn't allow sub-Scotland analysis. However, we would expect underreported incomes in those local areas that have a high share of their income coming from benefits, and also in local areas with many pensioners (whose main income source is the State Pension, a benefit).

The six council areas with the highest benefit shares are, according to SHS data, Dumfries & Galloway, Inverclyde, North Ayrshire, East Ayrshire, West Dunbartonshire, and Dundee City. The eight council areas with the largest proportion of pensioners are Na h-Eileanan Siar, Argyll & Bute, Dumfries & Galloway, South Ayrshire, Scottish Borders, Orkney Islands, Angus, and Perth and Kinross.

Breaking the country down to urban and rural areas, small towns and other (not large) urban areas have the highest shares of benefit income. Remote small towns and remote rural areas on the other hand have the largest proportions of pensioners.

# Total income overall

Having identified some issues in the measurement of the various _income components_, we will now see how these affect total income.

The income **distributions** in the SHS and the HBAI look largely similar, with the SHS income distribution being slightly wider, and the SHS **median** slightly lower. Near the relative poverty threshold, the SHS cumulative income curve is higher, meaning more households sit below that threshold in the SHS compared to the HBAI. This means that more people are considered to be in relative poverty when using the SHS dataset compared to the HBAI dataset.

The nine income decile points (the thresholds in each dataset that split the populations into ten equal-sized groups) are at similar levels in the two surveys for high incomes, and diverge towards lower incomes, with SHS incomes being lower. This shows that more households in the SHS have lower incomes compared to the HBAI, whereas the high income end of the distribution matches better between surveys. We have seen this is largely caused by benefit underreporting in the SHS (relative to the HBAI). The lower the income, the more important benefit income becomes, and the more affected total income is by benefit underreporting.

Median income C.I.s overlap to some degree for all 22 **council areas** where we compared surveys. We excludes those council areas where the HBAI household populations were too far off. For some council areas, the overlaps are only marginal, such as Renfrewshire, Aberdeenshire, East Dunbartonshire, and Stirling, despite some of these having relatively large HBAI sample sizes (Aberdeenshire, Renfrewshire). Note also, that none of these areas were noted earlier for particularly high pensioner shares or benefit income shares. However, C.I.s for all council areas and for both surveys are fairly wide, showing much income variation within each council area. {>> What's wrong with these council areas? Might be good to check what the overlaps look like for different data years, i.e. SHS 2019 (pre-release access only) or HBAI 2017/18 <<}

Median incomes match fairly well for **urban** and accessible rural areas. Median incomes in remote rural areas and in small towns match slightly less well, but also have fairly wide C.I.s.

Median incomes of **working-age adults** and **children** match well, but **pensioners**' incomes are much lower in the SHS, and C.I.s do not overlap. We saw that this is largely due to underreporting of the State Pension, as well as occupational pensions and investment income.

Incomes for most **household types** match well, except, again, for pensioners, whose income is much lower in the SHS. Incomes of households with 3 or more adults (and no children) have very wide C.I.s, indicating large variation of incomes in this group. Single adult incomes match surprisingly well, seeing how much benefit income is underreported for this group. However, earnings in thise group are higher in the SHS than the HBAI and appear to balance out the benefit underreporting.

Incomes of households where the household head (the highest income householder) is a **full- or part-time employee** match fairly well, which is no surprise as income from employed earnings also matches fairly well. Income of **self-employed households** varies widely and C.I.s overlap only little between the two survey. As expected, incomes of the **retired** don't match well, similarly to pensioners' incomes in the age group and household type breakdowns. Incomes of the **disabled** also don't match too well, due to undereporting of disability benefits, which are the main income source of these households.
