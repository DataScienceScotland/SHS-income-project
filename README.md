# SHS-income-project
This repository contains the code used for the analysis resulting in the [SHS income analysis report](https://www.gov.scot/publications/shs-income-analysis/) published on 20 November 2020.

# Run all
Run run_all.R runs all scripts in order. Note that the datasets (SHS and HBAI datasets imported from SAS and saved as .rds files) are not included in this repository.

# Code snippets
code_snippets.R is not a required script, but shows how equivalence factors, equivalised net household income after council tax, and relative poverty before housing tax can be calculated.
