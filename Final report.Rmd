# Introduction

This report is the result of a project where we assessed in detail how accurately the Scottish Household Survey (SHS) measures household income. We did this by comparing SHS data to data from the Household Below Average Incomes (HBAI) dataset, the “gold standard” for household income data in the UK.

The comparison showed that SHS-based income estimates are accurate enough to determine whether a household is in poverty (before housing costs). We will therefore include a poverty flag in the SHS dataset, enabling analysts to produce poverty breakdowns of any SHS-based measure of interest.

## Purpose

The purpose of the project was to understand whether SHS income data is accurate enough to allow household income and poverty analysis in Scotland where this is not possible using the HBAI or administrative data sources. For example, income and poverty analysis in Scotland is not possible with HBAI or administrative data for certain subgroups of the population where the HBAI sample is too small, or where these subgroups are not identified in the administrative data. This is also the case for a wide range of contexts which are not covered or not covered in as much detail in the HBAI or administrative data, such as travel patterns, social capital, satisfaction with services, house condition, digital inclusion and financial inclusion.

It should be noted that we are not proposing a wholesale shift in reporting income and poverty statistics from HBAI to SHS income data; the HBAI will remain the main source of national (Scotland-level) poverty and household income statistics, with SHS statistics providing supplementary income and poverty analysis where not available from HBAI or administrative data.

## Background

Local authority level poverty estimates based on the Scottish Household Survey were released in 2010 as experimental statistics. Following publication, there were concerns about how these related to other proxy measures, such as benefit claimants. A review conducted in 2011 concluded that the methodology was robust, even though income estimates for additional adults within a multi-adult household were imputed rather than captured directly.

Further work was carried out to investigate the quality of the SHS data and the imputation procedures, including looking in particular at pensioners’ incomes as there seemed to be a problem with under-reporting of pensioners’ incomes. A 2013 report concluded that there were many reasons to expect differences between poverty and benefit-based proxies at local level. It also found good agreement between the FRS and SHS; although there were several reasons why SHS income data may not be appropriate to use with the same confidence as the FRS data:

- information is provided "off the top of the head" as part of an interview on many other topics. There is no requirement to refer to pay slips or bank statements to check the figures.
- Although overall income from benefits agrees well between the surveys, individual benefits may be less accurately classified in the SHS
- Around a third of households in the SHS are unwilling or unable to provide complete income information and have some component of income imputed at the data processing stage of the survey.

The 2013 report also suggested developing a suite of SHS questions looking at material deprivation to add to the understanding of poverty. That work resulted in the 'families with limited resources' measure first published in 2017. This measure combines low levels of income and not being able to afford a number of basic material necessities.
However, similarly to the initial release of the SHS local income estimates, stakeholder response to this new measure included a degree of uncertainty, as some of the results were counter-intuitive. It is not clear whether the unexpected results stem for the income, or the material deprivation aspect of the measure.

In 2018, additional questions were added to the SHS to collect income data from the additional adults, reducing the amount of information that needs to be imputed. With this new income information now available, this project aims to conclusively describe how accurately the SHS is able to estimate income and poverty.

# Conclusions

We conclude that the SHS measures income accurately enough to identify households that are in poverty. However, there are some groups of households where this...

## Key results

1. The SHS income variable compares reasonably well with HBAI income, and produces very good income estimates considering the wide remit of the survey.
2. The SHS income variable produces reliable BHC poverty estimates for children and working-age adults, although care needs to be taken when looking specifically at economically inactive or self-employed households.
3. SHS-based regional poverty breakdowns are possible where sample sizes allow, although it would be advisable to always include some measure of uncertainty.
4. It might be best to exclude pensioners from any SHS-based income and poverty analysis until state pension reporting is improved.
5. SHS-based income and poverty estimates differ from the Official Statistics and can therefore not be compared directly; this needs to be highlighted and differences explained in any publications using this data.
6. Guidance is required that clearly explains when to use which data source, with the Official Statistics followed by CiLIF taking priority over SHS-based poverty estimates.

## Implications

## Key issues

- pensioners / state pension
- other benefits / economically inactive / disabled
- economic status

# Guidance

## When to use which data source

- table

## Expected differences

## What to look out for

- pensioners
- economically inactive
- self employed

## Housing costs


# Recommendations

- Continue to collect income data from all adults

## SHS dataset changes

- use imputed state pension
- use imputed council tax and add variable
- add equivalisation factors
- add poverty flag (before housing costs)


## SHS questionnaire changes

- Consider allowing negative incomes for self-employed people
- Review how State Pension data is collected in the SHS, and whether changes to the questionnaire wording or data editing / imputation routines may improve the data quality for this key benefit
- review self-employed data collection

## Further work

- Housing costs: The SHS includes a housing cost variable which could be used to produce after housing cost (AHC) income and poverty measures. There are some differences between surveys in what is considered a housing cost. The main difference affects home owners with a mortgage: While the HBAI considers the mortgage interest a housing cost but not capital repayments, the SHS includes both. Either method has merit, but each will lead to a quite different result for these households: We expect housing costs for home owners with a mortgage to be higher in the SHS compared to the HBAI; therefore AHC poverty will be higher for this group as well. Further work might involve a comparison of housing costs across surveys, investigating the impact of the different definitions on AHC poverty estimates, and finding ways to clearly communicate the differences between HBAI- and SHS-based housing costs.
-	Self-employed earnings: Self-employed earnings are much higher in the SHS compared to the HBAI. Checking with SHS data from previous years shows that this high level of self-employed earnings is consistent across years. The difference between surveys could be caused by questionnaire wording, survey time spent on self-employed earnings, or different definitions of self-employment. Further work could investigate the causes of the difference further.
